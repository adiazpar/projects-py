Homework 5 Exercise 2

Exercise 2:
Write three Python classes named Rectangle constructed by a length and width, a Circle
constructed by a radius, and a Square constructed by a side length. All classes should have the
methods that compute:

    - The area
    - The diagonal of the Rectangle or Square class, and the diameter of the Circle class
    - The perimeter

Use as much inheritance as you can. Import the math module, so you can call methods like sqrt().
At the end of the code, use these classes and methods to calculate the perimeter of a circle with
a radius thatâ€™s half of the diagonal of a rectangle with a length of 20 and width 10.
