Homework 5 Exercise 1
Name: Alejandro Diaz
Due Date: 11/09/23

Exercise 1:
Write an iterator class ReverseIter, that takes a list and iterates it from the reverse direction.
An example could be like this (hint â€“ use a list as the input argument of your constructor):

    # >>> it = ReverseIter([1, 2, 3, 4])
    # >>> next(it)
    # 4
    # >>> next(it)
    # 3
    # >>> next(it)
    # 2
    # >>> next(it)
    # 1
    # >>> next(it)
    # Traceback (most recent call last):
    # File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    # StopIteration
