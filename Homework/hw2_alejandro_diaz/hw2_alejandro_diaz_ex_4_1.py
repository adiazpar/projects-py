Develop a “Guess the number” game. Write a program that comes up with a random
number between 1 and 20 (both inclusive), and the player has to guess it within 10 tries.

If after 10 times the player’s guesses were all wrong, print a message “Sorry, the number
I was thinking of was xx”. Otherwise, the program output should look like the following:

    I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20. You have 10 tries.
    Take a guess.
    10
    Your guess is too low.
    Take a guess.
    15
    Your guess is too low.
    Take a guess.
    17
    Your guess is too high.
    Take a guess.
    16
    Good job! You guessed my number in 4 guesses!
