Homework 2
Name: Alejandro Diaz
Due Date: 09/22/23

Exercise 2:
Add try and except statements to the previous exercise (the collatz sequence) to detect whether
the user enters a non-integer value. Normally, the int() function will raise a ValueError error if it
is passed a non-integer string, as in int('puppy'). In the except clause, print a message to the user
saying they must enter an integer.
