Exercise 1:
Write a program that lets the user enter an integer and keeps calling collatz() on that number
until the function returns value 1. (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any
integer—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1. Even mathematicians aren’t sure
why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the
simplest impossible math problem.”) The output of this program could look something like the
following.

    Enter number:
    3
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
